# Project Snapify

This is the monorepo containing all the snaps and dapps for snap-ify

Project Snapfy aims to enable developers build scalable projects without re-inventing the wheel. We do this by identifying key functionalities that are necessary for every dapp in the ecosystem. This is made possible by utilizing the power of Metamask Snaps.

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that can customize the wallet experience.
