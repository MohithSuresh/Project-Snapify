# Vertical Wallet Snap

## Hypothesis
We wonâ€™t all just be using MetaMask in a few years if it dosn't adapt on time.

## Reasoning behind Hypothesis

1) In the history of cryptocurrency, the distribution of user personas is at its most diverse. More and more people were added to the ecosystem with each innovation cycle. Even while all of these groups are similar, their preferences are highly diverse.

2) People were drawn to 2009 (the OGs) by stateless money and cutting-edge P2P computing. High-caliber software developers became interested in the emerging smart contracts design space in 2014.

3) Tech-savvy financial professionals keen to test out DeFi arrived in 2017. Additionally, the most recent wave drew more gamers, online makers, digital artists, and retail customers who were purchasing their first and only NFT.

4) These organizations all interact with quite different kinds of applications. The logical extension is that they use their wallet as their primary, interoperable web3 UI to search out various goods.

5) An NFT trader, for instance, would probably want a wallet that displays their collection and keeps track of floor pricing. A degen probably wants to know the state of their staking APYs, the health of their leverage positions across various protocols, etc.
 
6) Additionally, mainstream consumers who are interested in experimenting with web3 social are presumably looking for a slick, clear UI with nothing like what I outlined above to interfere with their user experience; it will also probably be instructional. Mass retail likely wants separate wallets so that personal financial information is not shared.

7) Although not a 1:1 example, the tendency is clear: traditionally, users have turned to a UI that specifically meets their needs when a larger base of users seeks a highly specialized product experience. Why might wallets differ from other items?

**Conclusion:** When a wider base of users seek a very specific product experience, they have historically gone to a UI matching that particular need.

## What We've Built

The product is a way to organize the dapp ecosystem related to Metamask. For the Dapps, it'll facilitate the marketing and publicity of dapps at one place, catalyzing the growth of the whole ecosystem. For the end user, it makes the usage of different services (provided by dapps) simpler and transparent as all important things are authenticated and organized at one place. Just by one click the user will be able to go to the authentic dapp site ready to use the service. If the user wants to install specific snaps, they can do so from this site ensuring transparency. They could also organize their most used dapps in this site.

## Features
The product has 4 tabs:

1. **Dapps:** Offers a comprehensive list of decentralized applications that can be used on the platform. The list is organized in alphabetical order and can be filtered based on network to help users find the dapps they need. A search option is also available for users to find specific dapps quickly and easily. Once a dapp is found, users can open it by clicking on the button beside its name.

2. **Featured:** Showcases a limited number of hand-picked decentralized applications that are considered to be among the best available. These dapps are not organized in alphabetical order but instead are sorted based on their popularity. A short description of each dapp is provided below its name to give users an idea of what the dapp does. To open a featured dapp, users can simply click on the button beside its name.

3. **Snaps:** Features a list of pre-installed decentralized applications that are quick and easy to access. The list is organized in alphabetical order and can be searched to help users find specific snaps. To install a snap, users simply need to click on the button beside its name. The snaps in this tab offer a seamless user experience.

4. **Saved:** Displays all the decentralized applications that a user has saved for later use. The list of saved dapps is organized in alphabetical order, making it easy for users to find the dapps they need. This tab provides quick and convenient access to saved dapps, without the need to search for them again.
